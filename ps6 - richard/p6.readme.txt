To run, in MySQL Command Line Client:

mysql> source <DIRECTORY HERE>\p6.sql;

For the php pages, on the top of the following files:

	parta.php
	partb.php
	partc.php
	partd.php
	parte.php
	
change line 8 from

$con = mysql_connect("localhost:3306","root","homework");

to whereever the database is stored and the correct user/password.

Put all the files along with index.php into a directory and index.php is now the working webpage!
